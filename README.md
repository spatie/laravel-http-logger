This package adds a middleware which can log incoming requests to the default log. 
If anything goes wrong during a user's request, you'll still be able to access the original request data sent by that user.

This log acts as an extra safety net for critical user submissions, such as forms that generate leads.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-http-logger
```

You can publish the config-file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\HttpLogger\HttpLoggerServiceProvider" --tag="config" 
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * The log profile which determines whether a request should be logged.
     * It should implement `LogProfile`.
     */
    'log_profile' => \Spatie\HttpLogger\LogNonGetRequests::class,

    /*
     * The log writer used to write the request to a log.
     * It should implement `LogWriter`.
     */
    'log_writer' => \Spatie\HttpLogger\DefaultLogWriter::class,

    /*
     * Filter out body fields which will never be logged.
     */
    'except' => [
        'password',
        'password_confirmation',
    ],

];
```

## Usage

This packages provides a middleware which can be added as a global middleware or as a single route.

```php
// in `app/Http/Kernel.php`

protected $middleware = [
    // ...
    
    \Spatie\HttpLogger\Middlewares\HttpLogger::class
];
```

```php
// in a routes file

Route::get('/my-form', function () {
    //
})->middleware(\Spatie\HttpLogger\Middlewares\HttpLogger::class);
```

### Logging

Two classes are used to handle the logging of incoming requests: 
a `LogProfile` class will determine whether the request should be logged,
and `LogWriter` class will write the request to a log. 

A default log implementation is added within this package. 
It will only log `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests 
and it will write to the default Laravel logger.

You're free to implement your own log profile and/or log writer classes, 
and configure it in `config/http-logger.php`.

A custom log profile must implement `\Spatie\HttpLogger\LogProfile`. 
This interface requires you to implement `shouldHandleRequest`.

```php
// Example implementation from `\Spatie\HttpLogger\LogNonGetRequests`

public function shouldLogRequest(Request $request): bool
{
   return in_array(strtolower($request->method()), ['post', 'put', 'patch', 'delete']);
}
```

A custom log writer must implement `\Spatie\HttpLogger\LogWriter`. 
This interface requires you to implement `logRequest`.

```php
// Example implementation from `\Spatie\HttpLogger\DefaultLogWriter`

public function logRequest(Request $request): void
{
    $method = strtoupper($request->getMethod());
    
    $uri = $request->getPathInfo();
    
    $bodyAsJson = json_encode($request->except(config('http-logger.except')));

    $message = "{$method} {$uri} - {$bodyAsJson}";

    Log::info($message);
}
```
